Method:
	Data:
		We have been provided 3 data files (CSV format)
		which contain information from ~1500 tablets. One
		file contains each line-by-line readout of a tablet.
		Another provides a list of all the referenced names
		and geographical locations (known as PNs and GNs).

	Procedure:
		Our first approach was to use the frequency of appearance
		of the names that are found across each tablet. Once we knew
		all the possible years the names were found in, we cross referenced
		the names of the unknown tablets to determine the "best fit" for
		the tablet. We saw accuracies between 40%-55% when used on 
		tablets we knew the years for. This, however, was only on
		a deterministic set of tablets and did not use GNs.

		Our second approach was more effective and lead to better
		results. Using 3 different machine learning 
		models - Perceptron, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and 
		Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes - we split up the tablets into 
		80%-20% sample sets that are randomized and shuffled every 
		time. We train each model on the 80% set, and then have 
		it make predictions on the 20% sample set. Once the model 
		is done predicting, we compare the results to the actual 
		answers (since they are tablets we know the years of). 
		We observed 50-65% accuracies. However, once GNs were
		included, we obtained 75%-85% identification accuracy.
